== Description

This is an application allowing the collection of reference desk statistics through a web application with Flask.

== Requirements

This application requires:

* +Flask+
** +Flask-Babel+
** +Flask-Login+
* +Python-LDAP+

Simply +pip-install+ them and you'll be on your way out.

== Database

The database used is PostgreSQL. The file +schema.sql+ will have all of the SQL needed to generate the tables/permissions/views that the application demands.

== Babel Install
    
Language translations for french are already included with the application, and should work out of the box.
In the case they don't:

    pybabel compile -i messages.pot -d translations/

should be enough to fix it.
    
== Secret Key

You'll need to generate your own secret key to sign cookies. Generally, the easiest way to do this would be:
    
    >>> import os
    >>> os.urandom(24).encode('hex')
    
Which will give you a nice, long sequence of hex digits.
